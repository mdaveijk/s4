In the context of the Linux command line, `#` and `$` are symbols typically used to represent the command prompt, and they can tell you about the permissions of the user:

- `$` is the default prompt symbol for a regular user. When you see this, it means you're logged in with ordinary privileges, and you're less likely to inadvertently run a command that could harm your system.
- `#` is the default prompt symbol for the root user, also known as the superuser (su). If you see this, it means you have administrative privileges that allow you to execute potentially dangerous commands that can affect the system's critical operations.

In scripts or on the command line, these symbols also have other meanings:
- `#` is used for comments in shell scripts and command lines. Anything on the line after a `#` is ignored by the shell and is not executed. This is useful for leaving notes in your scripts to explain what a particular section of code is doing.
- `$` is used to denote environment variables or to retrieve the values of shell variables. For example, `$PATH` would give you the value stored in the `PATH` variable.

## OverTheWire assignments (Level 0 - 11)

I did OverTheWire on a virtual Linux machine running Ubuntu 22. I learned that this is good practice for security reasons since you're still connecting to a certain network with other people.

New things I learned:
- `ssh` to set up a secure shell environment.
- `strings` is used to identify human-readable text.
- `find` has useful parameters, like -f (files only)
- `file` used to find the type of file, in OverTheWire it was used to find the only human-readable file among others. `file -- *` (-- to ignore the fact it had a - attached to it and `*` as a joker, to read all of the files quickly. <u>VERY USEFUL</u>)
- `sort` organizes lines of text alphabetically or numerically, helps preparing data for other commands like `uniq` that require sorted input to function effectively.
- `uniq` filters or reports unique lines in a file, particularly effective when used after `sort` to eliminate duplicate entries. Often used with flags like `-c` to count occurrences. 
### Level 10 - 11
- `base64` is a command used to transform binary data into readable data. For level 10, I needed to use the pipe command, first taking the data inside the file (`cat`) and then pass it onto `base64` to decode it: `cat data.txt | base64 -d`. Important is that I used the `-d` parameter to tell the command to decode it.
- Level 11 deals with ROT13, a more fun than useful encoding technique. It rotates all 13th characters, like A becoming N, etc. I had to use the translate command here, `tr`, and specify what exactly should be transformed. The problem was to solve upper and lower case characters and remember that ROT13 has been applied. So the final command looked like this: `cat data.txt | tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]'` the answer could be found on the Wikipedia page about ROT13, it required something similar to Regex. 

## Linux basics for the aspiring hacker
### Part: 12 The Kernel and Loadable Kernel Modules

>In my continuing series on [Linux basics for aspiring hackers](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/linux-basics/), I now want to address Loadable kernel modules (LKMs), which are key to the Linux administrator because they provide us the capability to add functionality to the kernel without having to recompile the kernel. Things like video and other device drivers can now be added to the kernel without shutting down the system, recompiling, and rebooting.
>Loadable kernel modules are critical to the hacker because if we can get the Linux admin to load a new module to their kernel, we not only own their system, but because we are at the kernel level of their operating system, we can control even what their system is reporting to them in terms of processes, ports, services, hard drive space, etc.
>So, if we can offer the Linux user/admin a "new and improved" video driver with our [rootkit](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/listeners/) embedded in it, we can take control of his system and kernel. This is the way some of the most insidious rootkits take advantage of the Linux OS.
>So, I hope it's clear that understanding LKMs is key to being an effective Linux admin and being a VERY effective and stealthy hacker.

- `sysctl` is not persistent between reboots. The settings are reset when you turn it on again. To make changes persistent, we have to edit the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file. 
> One of the ways we may want to use **sysctl** for hacking is to enable ipforwarding (net.ipv4.conf.default.forwarding) for [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hack-like-pro-conduct-simple-man-middle-attack-0147291/). From a hardening perspective, we can disable ICMP echo requests (net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all) so as to make more difficult, but not impossible, for hackers to find our system.

My Linux distribution (Ubuntu 22) doesn't support modprobe yet. So I'll have to use `insmod` and `rmmod` to handle modules. I can list them with `lsmod`.

> Remember, the LKM modules are a convenience to a Linux user/admin, but are a major security weakness of Linux and one the professional hacker should be familiar with. As I said before, the LKM can be the perfect vehicle to get your rootkit into the kernel and wreak havoc!

I tried some of the other levels but these were hard to mess with since I'm using a virtual computer on Netlab. Due to time constraints, I decided to only do some extra OverTheWire levels to gain some additional knowledge on Linux.
